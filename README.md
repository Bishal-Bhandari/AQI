# 🌫️ AQI Prediction Tool  
A Python-based machine learning system for forecasting future Air Quality Index (AQI) values using weather and historical pollution data.  
The project focuses on **accurate AQI prediction**, model performance, and data processing — not on AQI display tools that already exist.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
While many dashboards already show **current AQI**, very few provide **reliable AQI forecasts**.  
This project fills that gap by:

- Predicting **AQI for the next 1–7 days**
- Using weather factors such as:
  - Temperature  
  - Humidity  
  - Wind speed  
  - Pressure  
  - Weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rain, etc.)
- Training multiple ML models and comparing their accuracy
- Providing interpretable results and feature importance

This tool is mainly intended for:
- Researchers  
- Environmental engineers  
- Students  
- City-level air quality planning
